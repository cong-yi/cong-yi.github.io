I am a postdoctoral research and teaching fellow in the [Department of Computer Science at UBC](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/) with Prof. [Alla Sheffer](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~sheffa/). Prior to this position, I served as a research associate at [HKU CS](https://www.cs.hku.hk/) working with Prof. [Wenping Wang](https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/profiles/Wang-Wenping.html). I also spent a year as a visiting researcher at [the Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home) with Prof. [Christian Theobalt](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~theobalt/). I earned my Ph.D. in computer science from [Peking University](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/en/) and my B.Sc. in mathematics from [Fudan University](https://math.fudan.edu.cn/mathen/main.htm). My recent research topics are focused on neural shape representation, AI for 3D content generation, human–computer interaction, and 3D reconstruction.

**I am an incoming Assistant Professor in the [Computer Science Department at UT Dallas](https://cs.utdallas.edu/) and am currently looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students starting in Fall 2025. If you're interested in working with me, please feel free to send me your CV.**
