I am a postdoctoral fellow at [the Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.hku.hk/) in [the University of Hong Kong](https://hku.hk/). Before joining HKU, I received my Ph.D. degree from [the School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/en/), [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), and my B.Sc. degree from [the School of Mathematical Science](https://math.fudan.edu.cn/mathen/main.htm), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/).

My research interests include 3D reconstruction and modeling, augmented reality and virtual reality, and humanâ€“computer interaction.


<!---Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.--->
