I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Department of Computer Science at UBC](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/) with Prof. [Alla Sheffer](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~sheffa/). Prior to this position, I served as a research associate at [HKU CS](https://www.cs.hku.hk/) under the supervision of Prof. [Wenping Wang](https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/profiles/Wang-Wenping.html). I also spent a year as a visiting researcher at [the Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home) with Prof. [Christian Theobalt](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~theobalt/). I earned my Ph.D. in computer science from [Peking University](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/en/) and my B.Sc. in mathematics from [Fudan University](https://math.fudan.edu.cn/mathen/main.htm). My recent research topics are focused on neural geometric representation, humanâ€“computer interaction, image-based 3D generation, and 3D reconstruction.
